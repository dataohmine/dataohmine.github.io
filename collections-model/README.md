## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dataohmine/collections-model.git
cd collections-model

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Run the entire pipeline
python main.py --config config.json

# Run specific steps
python main.py --steps consolidation features training
python main.py --steps testing
```

### Individual Components
```python
# Data consolidation
from src.data_consolidation import DataConsolidator
consolidator = DataConsolidator(config)
df = consolidator.consolidate_sources(sources)

# Feature engineering
from src.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer
engineer = FeatureEngineer(config)
df_features = engineer.engineer_features(df, 'target')

# Model training
from src.model_training import ModelTrainer
trainer = ModelTrainer(config)
model = trainer.train_model(X_train, y_train)

# A/B testing
from src.ab_testing import ABTester
tester = ABTester(config)
results = tester.analyze_results(df, 'group', 'outcome')
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize the pipeline:

```json
{
  "target_column": "collection_success",
  "data_sources": [...],
  "feature_engineering": {
    "max_features": 100,
    "interaction_pairs": [...]
  },
  "model_training": {
    "optimize_hyperparameters": true,
    "optimization_trials": 100
  },
  "ab_testing": {
    "alpha": 0.05,
    "expected_effect_size": 0.2
  }
}
```
